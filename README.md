<h1>What is QR code</h1>
QR code or Quick Response code is a two-dimensional barcode that can be read by a QR code reader or scanner. It was first invented in 1994 by a Japanese company named Denso Wave, and since then, it has become a ubiquitous feature of modern life. QR codes have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their versatility, convenience, and ease of use. They can be used for a variety of applications, such as product tracking, mobile payments, and marketing campaigns. In this article, we will explore the history, functionality, and usage of QR codes in detail.

<h2>History of QR Code:</h2>

QR code was first invented in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of the Japanese company Toyota. The primary purpose of QR code was to track vehicle parts during the manufacturing process. It was designed to be more efficient than traditional barcodes, which could only hold a limited amount of data. QR codes were designed to hold much more data than barcodes and could be read much faster than traditional barcodes.

<h2>Functionality of QR Code:</h2>

QR codes work by storing data in a two-dimensional pattern of black and white squares. The pattern can be read by a QR code reader or scanner, which decodes the information stored in the code. QR codes can store different types of data, including text, URLs, phone numbers, email addresses, and more.

QR codes are designed to be easily scanned by smartphones and other mobile devices. Most smartphones come with a built-in QR code reader, or you can download a free QR code scanner app from your app store. Once you scan a QR code, your smartphone will automatically open the content stored in the code.

<h2>Usage of QR Code:</h2>

QR codes have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their versatility and ease of use. They can be used for a variety of applications, including:

Product Tracking: QR codes can be used to track products through the supply chain. Manufacturers can use QR codes to track products from the factory to the store shelf, allowing them to monitor inventory levels and identify potential issues with the supply chain.

Mobile Payments: QR codes can be used to make mobile payments. Many payment apps, such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, use QR codes to facilitate transactions. Customers can simply scan the QR code with their smartphone to make a payment.

Marketing Campaigns: QR codes can be used in marketing campaigns to provide customers with additional information or promotional offers. For example, a restaurant might put a QR code on its menu, which customers can scan to see nutritional information or get a discount code for their next meal.

Event Ticketing: QR codes can be used to facilitate event ticketing. Instead of printing out a paper ticket, customers can receive a QR code on their smartphone, which can be scanned at the event to gain entry.

Contactless Check-In: QR codes can be used for contactless check-in at hotels, airports, and other locations. Customers can scan a QR code with their smartphone to check in, reducing the need for face-to-face interactions.
